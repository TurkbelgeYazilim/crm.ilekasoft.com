# CUSTOMER LIST PAGE ISSUE RESOLVED

**Date:** June 19, 2025  
**Issue:** Customer list page at https://crm.ilekasoft.com/cari/cari-listesi was not loading/opening properly  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

## Problem Summary

After successfully fixing the customer edit form issue, a new problem emerged: the customer list page was not loading. The routing was correct (`$route['cari/cari-listesi'] = 'cari/cariListesi';`), but the page failed to open.

## Root Cause Analysis

Investigation revealed that the `cariListesi()` method was **completely missing** from the `application/controllers/Cari.php` controller. The routing was pointing to a non-existent method, causing the page load failure.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing `cariListesi()` Method

Added a complete `cariListesi()` method to the Cari controller with the following features:

```php
public function cariListesi()
{
    $data["baslik"] = "Cari / Cari Listesi";
    $anaHesap = anaHesapBilgisi();
    
    // User permission system - only show customers created by user or subordinates
    $control = session("r", "login_info");
    $u_id = $control->kullanici_id;
    
    $kullanicilarQ = "SELECT kullanici_id FROM kullanicilar WHERE kullanici_id = '$u_id' OR kullanici_sorumluMudur = '$u_id'";
    $kullanicilar = $this->db->query($kullanicilarQ)->result();
    
    // Build user ID list for filtering
    $kullanici_ids = array();
    foreach($kullanicilar as $kullanici) {
        $kullanici_ids[] = $kullanici->kullanici_id;
    }
    $kullanici_ids_str = implode(',', $kullanici_ids);
    
    // Search and filter functionality
    $cariKodu = $this->input->get('cariKodu');
    $cariAdi = $this->input->get('cariAdi');
    $cariTipi = $this->input->get('bireysel');
    // ... additional filters
    
    // Pagination setup (20 records per page)
    $sayfa = $this->input->get("sayfa");
    $page = $sayfa ? $sayfa : 0;
    $limit = 20;
    $pagem = $sayfa ? ($page - 1) * $limit : 0;
    
    // Dynamic query building with filters
    // Database queries with proper filtering and pagination
    // View loading with data
    $this->load->view("cari/cari-listesi", $data);
}
```

### 2. Key Features Implemented
